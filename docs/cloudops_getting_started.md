# CloudOps Prototype: Getting Started

This guide explains how to run the CloudOps simulation that ships with the
repository, validate it with automated tests, and begin extending it with your
own data or integrations. The prototype is intentionally lightweight so it can
run on a developer laptop without any external cloud access.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or later (the demo uses only the standard library)
- A virtual environment is recommended to isolate dependencies, although the
  demo does not require third-party packages
- Clone or download this repository locally

Optional tooling that improves the experience:

- `pytest` (installed automatically when you set up the development environment)
- An editor that supports Python type hints for exploring the connector
  interfaces

## 1. Set up your environment

From the repository root, create and activate a virtual environment (optional):

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Upgrade `pip` to ensure you can install any future dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Because the CloudOps prototype uses the Python standard library only, there is
no requirements file to install today. Future enhancements may introduce
additional packages.

## 2. Run the CloudOps simulation

Execute the demo module from the repository root:

```bash
python -m cloudops.run_demo
```

You should see a posture snapshot for AWS, Azure, and GCP along with
recommendations generated by the heuristic LLM advisor stub. The script wires the
static connectors together so you can review the multi-cloud resource graph,
security alerts, and cost observations without connecting to live accounts.

## 3. Validate with automated tests

The repository includes a small pytest suite that exercises the orchestration
facade and advisor logic. From the repository root run:

```bash
pytest
```

Use this command whenever you extend the connectors or platform logic to confirm
that you have not regressed the simulated behaviors.

## 4. Explore and extend

After you are comfortable running the demo, consider the following next steps:

1. **Customize sample data** – Modify the resource inventories in
   `cloudops/connectors/*.py` to mirror your environments and observe how the
   aggregated posture changes.
2. **Prototype new connectors** – Implement a subclass of `CloudConnector` in a
   new module and register it in `cloudops/connectors/__init__.py` so the
   platform can ingest additional providers.
3. **Replace heuristics with real LLM calls** – Update `cloudops/llm_advisor.py`
   to invoke OpenAI endpoints once you supply API credentials and prompt
   templates.
4. **Integrate with existing tooling** – Emit the platform outputs to JSON or
   message queues so downstream systems (ITSM, SIEM, or FinOps dashboards) can
   consume the insights.

Document the changes you make and add new unit tests alongside enhancements to
preserve confidence as the prototype evolves into a production-ready platform.
